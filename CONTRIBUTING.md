However, EdiTDor is an [Eclipse IoT](https://iot.eclipse.org) project and as such is governed by the Eclipse Development process.
This process helps us in creating great open source software within a safe legal framework.

Thus, before your contribution can be accepted by the project team, contributors must electronically sign the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA)](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php) and follow these preliminary steps:

- Obtain an [Eclipse Foundation account](https://accounts.eclipse.org/)
  - Anyone who currently uses Eclipse Bugzilla or Gerrit systems already has one of those
  - Newcomers can [create a new account](https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/register?destination=user)
- Add your GiHub username to your Eclipse Foundation account
  - ([Log into Eclipse](https://accounts.eclipse.org/))

  - Fill in the _GitHub ID_ under _Social Media Links_ and save
- Sign the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php)
  - ([Log into Eclipse](https://accounts.eclipse.org/))
  - If the _Status_ entry _Eclipse Contributor Agreement_ has a green checkmark, the ECA is already signed
  - If not, go to the _Eclipse Contributor Agreement_ tab or follow the corresponding link under _Status_
  - Fill out the form and sign it electronically
- Sign-off every commit using the same email address used for your Eclipse account
  - Set the Git user email address with `git config user.email "<your Eclipse account email>"`
